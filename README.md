# Process Sinica Trees
Hai Hu, Chien-Jer Charles Lin

Read in trees from Sinica Treebank and produce CFGs counts, depth of trees/relative clauses, etc.
For usage, type:

```python
python3 processST.py -h
```

Note: this [website](http://mshang.ca/syntree/) displays syntactic trees containing Chinese characters properly.

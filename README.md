# Process Sinica Trees
Hai Hu, Chien-Jer Charles Lin

Read in trees from Sinica Treebank and produce CFGs counts, depth of trees/relative clauses, etc.
For usage, type:

```python
python3 processST.py -h
```

Note: 

1. this [website](http://mshang.ca/syntree/) displays syntactic trees containing Chinese characters properly.
2. or use Latex to draw the tree which allows for more freedom and outputs a more beautiful one (see chinese_tree.txt)
